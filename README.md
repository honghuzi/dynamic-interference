# dynamic-interference
Dynamic interference induced by ac-stark shift and ionization

ac-stark shift and ionization intersection causes the dynamic interference fringes in the xuv ionization photoelectron spectrum.

Here we use the ansatz of linear ac-stark shift

\Delta(t) = const*g(t)^2

- in "di", \Delta(t) is not included, and the single ionization continuum is not considered.

- in "di-si", \Delta(t) is introduced to the ground state projecting on the ionization continuum.
